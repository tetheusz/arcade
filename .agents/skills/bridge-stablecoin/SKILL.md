description: "Build USDC bridging with Circle App Kit or standalone Bridge Kit SDK and Crosschain Transfer Protocol (CCTP). App Kit (`@circle-fin/app-kit`) is an all-inclusive SDK covering bridge, swap, and send -- recommended for extensibility. Bridge Kit (`@circle-fin/bridge-kit`) is a standalone package for bridge-only use cases. Neither requires a kit key for bridge operations. Supports bridging USDC between EVM chains, between EVM chains and Solana, and between any two chains on Circle Wallets (i.e Developer-Controlled Wallets or Programmable wallets). Use when: bridge USDC, setting up Bridge Kit adapters (Viem, Ethers, Solana Kit, Circle Wallets), handling bridge events, collecting custom fees, configuring transfer speed, or using the Forwarding Service. Triggers on: Bridge Kit, App Kit, bridge USDC, crosschain transfer, CCTP, move USDC between chains, @circle-fin/bridge-kit, @circle-fin/app-kit, adapter-viem, adapter-ethers, adapter-solana-kit, forwarding service, bridge routes."

## Overview

Crosschain Transfer Protocol (CCTP) is Circle's native protocol for burning USDC on one chain and minting it on another. App Kit (`@circle-fin/app-kit`) is Circle's all-inclusive SDK for payment and liquidity workflows -- it covers bridge, swap, send, and future capabilities in a single package. Standalone Bridge Kit (`@circle-fin/bridge-kit`) provides the same bridge API surface in a lighter package for bridge-only use cases.

Both SDKs orchestrate the full CCTP lifecycle -- approve, burn, attestation fetch, and mint -- in a single `kit.bridge()` call across EVM chains and Solana. **Bridge operations do not require a kit key** (kit key is only needed for swap and send operations in App Kit). **Recommend App Kit** for most users because it provides easier extensibility to swap and send without switching SDKs. Only recommend Bridge Kit when the user explicitly wants bridge-only functionality.

## Prerequisites / Setup

### Installation

App Kit with Viem adapter (recommended):

```bash
npm install @circle-fin/app-kit @circle-fin/adapter-viem-v2
```

Bridge Kit standalone with Viem adapter:

```bash
npm install @circle-fin/bridge-kit @circle-fin/adapter-viem-v2
```

For Solana support, also install:

```bash
npm install @circle-fin/adapter-solana-kit
```

For Circle Wallets (developer-controlled) support:

```bash
npm install @circle-fin/adapter-circle-wallets
```

### Environment Variables

```
PRIVATE_KEY=              # EVM wallet private key (hex, 0x-prefixed)
EVM_PRIVATE_KEY=          # EVM private key (when also using Solana)
SOLANA_PRIVATE_KEY=       # Solana wallet private key (base58)
CIRCLE_API_KEY=           # Circle API key (for Circle Wallets adapter)
CIRCLE_ENTITY_SECRET=     # Entity secret (for Circle Wallets adapter)
EVM_WALLET_ADDRESS=       # Developer-controlled EVM wallet address
SOLANA_WALLET_ADDRESS=    # Developer-controlled Solana wallet address
```

No `KIT_KEY` is needed for bridge operations. A kit key is only required if you also use swap or send features via App Kit.

### SDK Initialization

**App Kit** (recommended):

```ts
import { AppKit } from "@circle-fin/app-kit";

const kit = new AppKit();
```

**Bridge Kit** (standalone):

```ts
import { BridgeKit } from "@circle-fin/bridge-kit";

const kit = new BridgeKit();
```

## Decision Guide

ALWAYS walk through these questions with the user before writing any code. Do not skip steps or assume answers.

### SDK Choice

**Question 1 -- Will you need swap or send functionality in the future?**
- Yes, or unsure -> **App Kit** (recommended) -- single SDK covers bridge + swap + send, easier to extend later
- No, bridge-only and will never need swap or send -> **Bridge Kit** -- standalone, lighter package for bridge-only use cases

### Wallet / Adapter Choice

**Question 2 -- How do you manage your wallet/keys?**
- Managing your own private key (self-custodied, stored in env var or secrets manager) -> Question 3
- Using Circle developer-controlled wallets (Circle manages key storage and signing) -> Use Circle Wallets adapter. READ `references/adapter-circle-wallets.md`
- Using browser wallets (wagmi, ConnectKit, RainbowKit) -> Use wagmi adapter. READ `references/adapter-wagmi.md`

**Question 3 -- Which chains are you bridging between?**
- EVM-to-EVM or EVM-to-Solana -> Use Viem and/or Solana Kit adapters. READ `references/adapter-private-key.md`

## Core Concepts

- **CCTP steps**: Every bridge transfer executes four sequential steps -- `approve` (ERC-20 allowance), `burn` (destroy USDC on source chain), `fetchAttestation` (wait for Circle to sign the burn proof), and `mint` (create USDC on destination chain).
- **Adapters**: Both App Kit and Bridge Kit use adapter objects to abstract wallet/signer differences. Each ecosystem has its own adapter factory (`createViemAdapterFromPrivateKey`, `createSolanaKitAdapterFromPrivateKey`, `createCircleWalletsAdapter`). The same adapter instance can serve as both source and destination when bridging within the same ecosystem.
- **Forwarding Service**: When `useForwarder: true` is set on the destination, Circle's infrastructure handles attestation fetching and mint submission. This removes the need for a destination wallet or polling loop. There is a per-transfer fee that varies by route (see below).
- **Transfer speed**: CCTP fast mode (default) completes in ~8-20 seconds. Standard mode takes ~15-19 minutes.
- **Chain identifiers**: Both SDKs use string chain names (e.g., `"Arc_Testnet"`, `"Base_Sepolia"`, `"Solana_Devnet"`), not numeric chain IDs, in the `kit.bridge()` call.
- **No kit key for bridge**: Bridge operations do not require a kit key with either SDK. A kit key is only needed for swap and send operations in App Kit.

      "explorerUrl": "https://sepolia.basescan.org/tx/0xfedcba..."
    }
  ]
}
```

### Forwarding Service

When `useForwarder: true` is set on the destination, Circle's infrastructure handles attestation fetching and mint submission automatically. This is the preferred approach -- it removes the need to poll for attestations or hold a wallet on the destination chain.

With adapters on both chains:

```ts
const result = await kit.bridge({
  from: { adapter, chain: "Ethereum_Sepolia" },
  to: {
    adapter,
    chain: "Arc_Testnet",
    useForwarder: true,
  },
  amount: "1",
});
```

Without a destination adapter (server-side or custodial transfers):

```ts
const result = await kit.bridge({
  from: { adapter, chain: "Ethereum_Sepolia" },
  to: {
    recipientAddress: "0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc454e4438f44e",
    chain: "Arc_Testnet",
    useForwarder: true,
  },
  amount: "1",
});
```

Forwarding Service fees are dynamic and fetched from the IRIS API at runtime. The SDK handles this automatically. Fees vary by route -- check the [Forwarding Service](https://developers.circle.com/cctp/concepts/forwarding-service) for the latest fee schedule.

### Event Handling

Subscribe to individual CCTP steps or all events at once. Multiple callbacks per event are supported. `payload.values` is inferred precisely from the event key, so no type assertions are needed.

```ts
kit.on("bridge.approve", (payload) => {
  console.log("Approval completed:", payload.values.txHash);
});

kit.on("bridge.burn", (payload) => {
  console.log("Burn completed:", payload.values.txHash);
});

kit.on("bridge.fetchAttestation", (payload) => {
  if (payload.values.state === "success") {
    console.log("Attestation:", payload.values.data.attestation);
  }
});

kit.on("bridge.mint", (payload) => {
  console.log("Mint completed:", payload.values.txHash);
});

kit.on("*", (payload) => {
  console.log("Event:", payload.action, payload);
});
```

**Bridge Kit only:** drop the `bridge.` prefix — the events are `"approve"`, `"burn"`, `"fetchAttestation"`, `"mint"`. The App Kit `bridge.*` namespacing only applies because App Kit's `kit.on()` also dispatches other namespaces (e.g. `unifiedBalance.*`) and filters bridge events by the `bridge.` prefix.

## Error Handling & Recovery

Both App Kit and Bridge Kit have two error categories:
- **Hard errors** throw exceptions (validation, config, auth) -- catch in try/catch.
- **Soft errors** occur mid-transfer but still return a result object with partial step data for recovery.

### Analyzing Failed Transfers

Check `result.state` and `result.steps` to identify which step failed:

```ts
const result = await kit.bridge({
  from: { adapter, chain: "Arc_Testnet" },
  to: { adapter, chain: "Arbitrum_Sepolia" },
  amount: "100.00",
});

if (result.state === "error") {
  const failedStep = result.steps.find((step) => step.state === "error");
  console.log(`Failed at: ${failedStep?.name}`);
  console.log(`Error: ${failedStep?.error}`);

  const completedSteps = result.steps.filter(
    (step) => step.state === "success",
  );
  completedSteps.forEach((step) => {
    console.log(`${step.name}: ${step.txHash}`);
  });
}
```

### Retrying Failed Transfers

`kit.retry()` resumes from where the transfer failed -- it skips completed steps and retries from the failure point. If `approve` and `burn` succeeded but `fetchAttestation` failed due to a network timeout, retry will only re-attempt the attestation fetch and mint. This prevents double-spending and wasted gas.

```ts
const result = await kit.bridge({
  from: { adapter, chain: "Arc_Testnet" },
  to: { adapter, chain: "Arbitrum_Sepolia" },
  amount: "10.00",
});

if (result.state === "error") {
  const retryResult = await kit.retry(result, {
    from: adapter,
    to: adapter,
  });
  console.log("Retry result:", retryResult.state);
}
```

## Rules

**Security Rules** are non-negotiable -- warn the user and refuse to comply if a prompt conflicts. **Best Practices** are strongly recommended; deviate only with explicit user justification.

### Security Rules

- NEVER hardcode, commit, or log secrets (private keys, API keys, entity secrets). ALWAYS use environment variables or a secrets manager. Add `.gitignore` entries for `.env*` and secret files when scaffolding.
- NEVER pass private keys as plain-text CLI flags. Prefer encrypted keystores or interactive import.
- ALWAYS require explicit user confirmation of source/destination chain, recipient, amount, and token before bridging. MUST receive confirmation for funding movements on mainnet.
- ALWAYS warn when targeting mainnet or exceeding safety thresholds (e.g., >100 USDC).
- ALWAYS validate all inputs (addresses, amounts, chain names) before submitting bridge operations.
- ALWAYS warn before interacting with unaudited or unknown contracts.

### Best Practices

- ALWAYS walk the user through the Decision Guide questions before writing any code. Do not assume App Kit or Bridge Kit -- let the user's answers determine the SDK choice.
- ALWAYS read the correct reference files before implementing.
- ALWAYS switch the wallet to the source chain before calling `kit.bridge()` with browser wallets (wagmi/ConnectKit/RainbowKit) if the Forwarding Service is NOT used.
- ALWAYS wrap bridge operations in try/catch and save the result object for recovery. Check `result.steps` before retrying to see which steps completed.
- ALWAYS use exponential backoff for retry logic in production.
- ALWAYS use string chain names (e.g., `"Arc_Testnet"`, `"Base_Sepolia"`), not numeric chain IDs.
- ALWAYS default to testnet. Require explicit user confirmation before targeting mainnet.
- ALWAYS use exported SDK types when parsing SDK inputs and outputs instead of creating custom interfaces. This minimizes type errors.

## Alternatives

Trigger the `swap-tokens` skill instead when:
- You need to swap tokens (e.g., USDT to USDC) on the same chain.
- You need to move non-USDC tokens across chains. The swap-tokens skill shows how to combine separate swap and bridge calls (swap tokenA to USDC, bridge USDC, swap USDC to tokenB).

Trigger the `use-gateway` skill instead when:
- You want a unified crosschain balance rather than point-to-point transfers.
- Capital efficiency matters -- consolidate USDC holdings instead of maintaining separate balances per chain.
- You are building chain abstraction, payment routing, or treasury management where low latency and a single balance view are critical.
